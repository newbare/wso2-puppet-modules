| Component | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Publisher | Enables API providers to easily publish their APIs, share documentation, provision API keys, and gather feedback on API features, quality, and usage. |
| Store | Enables consumers to self-register, discover API functionality, subscribe to APIs, evaluate them, and interact with API publishers. |
| Key Manager | Responsible for all security and key-related operations. |
| Gateway | Responsible for securing, protecting, managing, and scaling API calls. |
