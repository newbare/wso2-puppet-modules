You can copy any JDK version tarball here 
which you are planning to use across the 
API Manager deployment cluster 

e.g.: 
/etc/puppet/files/java 	
                    |-- jdk-7u51-linux-x64.tar.gz
                    |-- jdk-7u67-linux-x64.tar.gz
                    |-- jdk-7u79-linux-x64.gz
                    `-- jdk-7u80-linux-x64.gz

To use a given JDK version across the cluster you have to 
do the following.
1. Go to /etc/puppet/environments/production/modules/wso2base/manifests
2. Open params.pp file to edit
3. Under Java section give your required JDK version
e.g.: 
    # Java
    $java_home  = "jdk1.7.0_79"
    $package    = "jdk-7u79-linux-x64.gz"
